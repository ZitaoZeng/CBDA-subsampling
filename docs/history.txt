At various times the following versions existed. The ones on github may still
be around, and the ones not in github might exist on various project computers.

We will use the following Github repository going forward:
https://github.com/simeonem/CBDA-subsampling

At one point a student (Zitao) created a version of the sampling code with some
changes and additional features.  These had several problems, including some
bugs and a lack of documentation. Those changes and features have been
implemented in the latest version in the current code base in
https://github.com/simeonem/CBDA-subsampling.

    It can be cloned using ssh public keys with:
    git clone git@github.com:simeonem/CBDA-subsampling.git

https://github.com/SOCR/CBDA/ in CBDA 20 R 2.0.0/Python
    This seems to be a very old, out of date, version of the initial version,
    without the changes made by Zitao.

    The full repository was last updated 2 years ago.

    CBDA 20 R 2.0.0/Python was last udpated 5 years ago.

https://github.com/simeonem/CBDAtemp, in CBDA R 2.0.0/Python
    This is the same as in https://github.com/SOCR/CBDA/ in CBDA 20 R 2.0.0/Python.

    The full repository was last updated 4 years ago.

CBDA-versions/Sample_UKBB.zip
    This is a version with the small rice data set, kept by Simeone Marino.
    It has the changes made by Zitao.

    This version is not in Github.

    It unzips to directory Sample_UKBB, the same directory name as
    Python_Subsampling.zip unzips to, so be carefull not to unzip
    both Sample_UKBB.zip and Python_Subsampling.zip in the same directory.

CBDA-versions/Python_Subsampling.zip
    This is the version with the big rice data set, kept by Simeone Marino.
